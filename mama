"This has cv2"
# Basically this creates shapes where movement is ocurring,
Codeline:
import cv2
cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
while cam.isOpened():
    ret, frame1 = cam.read()
    ret, frame2 = cam.read()
    diff = cv2.absdiff(frame1, frame2)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(diff, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)
    _, thresh = cv2.threshold(blur, 20, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
    dilated = cv2.dilate(thresh, None, iterations=3)
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(dilated, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    cv2.drawContours(frame1, contours, -1, (28, 36, 237), 4)
    if cv2.waitKey(10) == ord('q'):
        break
    cv2.imshow('You enter your window name here', frame1)
'PRESS "Q" or TO END WHILE TRUE':
      --> if cv2.waitKey(10) == ord('(THE CHARACTER YOU WANT TO USE TO BREAK THE LOOP'):
                break

Understand what I have done in the...

First few lines-
--> import cv2- This is obvious, imports the cv2 package
--> cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)- I am defining a variable here, "cam" which is telling the computer to open the webcam no. 0 i.e. the first one, to capture the exact picture in video.
--> while cam.isOpened():- As you can see, I have made a loop.

Now that I have imported everything, you can see for yourself what all of this means.
